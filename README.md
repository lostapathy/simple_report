simple_report is a gem for building simple reports from Enumerable collections.  It was extracted from a larger application and only supports Excel exports for now, but other formats could be added.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_report'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_report
